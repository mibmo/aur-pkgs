# AUR packages
These are the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org) packages that I ([mibu](aur-user)) maintain.
For any issues, please leave a comment on the relevant package.
You're welcome to open an issue here or send an email to [aur-pgks@kanp.ai](mailto://aur-pkgs@kanp.ai) if it's urgent (like version bumps or breaking bugs).

# Packages
### [`4nec-2bin`][pkg-4nec2-bin]: antenna modeler and optimizer
[4nec2]() is old software and hasn't seen an update in over a decade
so unless bugs are found in the PKGBUILD then this is unlikely to get any changes.

### [`lightburn-bin`][pkg-lightburn-bin]: layout, editing, and control software for laser cutters 
[lightburn](https://lightburnsoftware.com) is proprietary software.
It doesn't really get updated very frequently, but new versions can be found at the
[releases](https://github.com/LightBurnSoftware/deployment/releases)
tab of their deployment repo, so should there be an update please open an issue
or comment on the [AUR page][pkg-lightburn-bin].

### [`yetris`][pkg-yetris]: tetris in your terminal
I just picked up maintainership of the pkg after seeing it was disowned.
I've never touched the PKGBUILD and so far it's been working flawlessly.
If anyone else wants to volunteer for the maintainer role, be my guest.
